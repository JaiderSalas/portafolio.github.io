                <h3>Systems Engineer</h3>
                <p>I am a Systems Engineer with solid experience in both Software Development and Data Engineering,
                    specializing in the creation and implementation of scalable technology solutions. I have worked on
                    the development of data pipelines and ETL processes using cloud tools such as Azure Data Factory and
                    Azure Databricks, optimizing workflows and improving data accessibility in large-scale projects.
                    Additionally, I have experience in backend and frontend development, working with JavaScript,
                    Python, and SQL, as well as frameworks like React and Node.js to build dynamic and efficient
                    applications. My ability to handle databases such as SQL, Oracle, and MongoDB has allowed me to
                    deliver automated and high-performance solutions. I am passionate about technology and innovation,
                    and I continuously seek new challenges that enhance my skills in software development and data
                    engineering.
